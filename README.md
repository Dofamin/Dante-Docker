# Dante-Docker
Dante consists of a SOCKS server and a SOCKS client, implementing RFC 1928 and related standards. It can in most cases be made transparent to clients, providing functionality somewhat similar to what could be described as a non-transparent Layer 4 router. For customers interested in controlling and monitoring access in or out of their network, the Dante SOCKS server can provide several benefits, including security and TCP/IP termination (no direct contact between hosts inside and outside of the customer network), resource control (bandwidth, sessions), logging (host information, data transferred), and authentication.
